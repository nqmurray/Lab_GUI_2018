# New_Lab_Gui

### REBUILD BRANCH
Rebuild branch is the base GUIs for all measurement programs.  No parts have been added for Keithley, Lock in, or other measurement tools.  They are only to show a rough framework of how the measurements should work and to show that the GUI is functioning with all the necessary buttons/commands.

### DEVELOPED BRANCH
The full GUI program for each measurement.  The keithley and lockin functions have been added in but some bugs may still exist.  Once fixed it can be merged with master.
